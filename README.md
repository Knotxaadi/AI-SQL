# AI-SQL 🧠📊

**AI-SQL** is a smart, beginner-friendly project that integrates the power of **Artificial Intelligence** with traditional **SQL database queries**. Designed as my 12th-grade Computer Science practical project, this tool allows users to input **natural language questions**, which are then intelligently translated into **SQL commands**.

### 🌟 Features:
- Accepts natural language input (e.g., "Show me all students with marks above 90")
- Converts it into correct SQL syntax
- Executes queries on a sample database
- Displays results in a clean and readable format
- Simple Python + MySQL setup (perfect for students)

### 🎯 Purpose:
This project aims to simplify database interactions for beginners by using AI to bridge the gap between **human language** and **structured SQL queries**. It showcases how real-world tech (like AI and NLP) can make data handling more intuitive and accessible.

> 🛠️ Built using:
- Python (core logic)
- MySQL (backend database)
- OpenAI/transformer-like logic (conceptual, for translation)
