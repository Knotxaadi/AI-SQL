# AI-SQL 🧠📊

**AI-SQL** is an intuitive, beginner-friendly tool that merges the power of Artificial Intelligence with SQL database queries. Developed as my 12th-grade Computer Science practical project, AI-SQL allows users to input natural language questions, which are intelligently converted into SQL commands for seamless database interaction.

### 🌟 Features:
- Accepts natural language input (e.g., "Show me all students with marks above 90")
- Automatically generates accurate SQL syntax
- Converts it into correct SQL syntax
- Displays results in a clean and readable format
- Simple Python + MySQL setup (perfect for students)
- Supports multiple query types, including SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and aggregation functions like COUNT & AVG
- Handles common SQL errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Easy-to-use Python + MySQL setup, ideal for students and beginners
- Can be extended for larger datasets or more complex queries
- Educational tool for learning SQL and AI-powered query translation

### 🎯 Purpose:
**AI-SQL** is designed to **demystify database interactions** for beginners by bridging the gap between **human language and structured SQL queries**. It helps students and learners to:

Understand SQL syntax and logic without prior in-depth knowledge

Experiment with real-world queries in a safe and guided environment

Gain exposure to AI-powered natural language processing

Learn how AI can simplify complex database tasks

Explore the integration of AI with databases for practical applications

This project demonstrates the potential of combining **AI and database management**, providing a foundation for future projects involving **data analytics, intelligent query systems, and AI-assisted database tools**
